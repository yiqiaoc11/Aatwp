# On-Device Algorithm Efficiency Toolkit
ODAET is a C++ module that provides advanced algorithm acceleration for python applications in Pytorch/Tensorflow framework. Complexed algorithms logic were implemented upon Non-tensor data in low Time/Space complexity with Time/Memory restraints to improve learning, inference, filtering or data processing.
