# Algorithm Efficiency Toolkit for 
ODAET is a C++ module that provides advanced algorithm acceleration for python applications in Pytorch/Tensorflow framework. Complexed algorithms logic were implemented upon non-tensor data in low Time/Space complexity with Time/Memory restraints to improve learning, inference, filtering or data preparation to save latency and storage in real-time applications.
