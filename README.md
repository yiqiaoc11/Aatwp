On-Device Algorithm Efficiency Toolkit
 is a C++ library that provides advanced algorithm acceleration for on-device applications where complexed algorithms were implemented in low Time/Space complexity to meet requirement of target device with Time/Memory restraints to improve learning, inference and filtering performance.
